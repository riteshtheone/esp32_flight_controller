first:- all gain is 1 to see its working fine and in the right direction
second:- yaw p 3 and i 0.02 to minimize yaw rotation
         d gain set to 3
         increase untill becone restless
         decrease the d gain untill its become smooth again
         now decrease 25% and keep it

third: increase p gain at step 0.2 untill it become overcompansate then keep 50%

fourth: increase i gain at step 0.01 untill it become overcompansate slowaly then keep 50%

fifth: increase p gain untill its get fast oscillation
        then decrease it slowaly untill it will acceptable
